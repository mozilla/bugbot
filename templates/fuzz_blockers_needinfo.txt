This bug prevents fuzzing from making progress; however, it has low severity. It is important for fuzz blocker bugs to be addressed in a timely manner (see [here](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/tools/fuzzing/index.html#fuzz-blockers) why?).
:{{ nickname }}, could you consider increasing the severity?
